# Link Saver

it's a very simple application. i made it for myself because i'm always researching something and i need to save links to web pages. but when there are too many links i forget why i saved them. with this application i solved this problem
with this application you can store and manage all url links
you can add descriptions and categories to them and if you want you can add more than one category.


the application was developed with .net core. I used winfrom. you can run a web server inside the application if you want.

this application has a google extension
I provide a connection between google extension and the app using web server.
using web server and google extension is optional. you can use it if you want.

### application features

- you can work simultaneously with google extension
- you can back up your records
- when registering urls you can add multiple categories, titles and descriptions to them
- You can filter the url by category, title and description
- **If you want to activate the web service, port localhost:5003 should not be in use by another application. You can change the localhost settings in the ApiRun method in program.cs. !!**
